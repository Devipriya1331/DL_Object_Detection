# DL_Object_Detection
A real-time object recognition system using OpenCV and MobileNet-SSD that detects and classifies objects from a live webcam feed, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores efficiently.
# Real-Time Object Recognition using MobileNet-SSD

This project implements a **real-time object recognition system** using **OpenCV’s DNN module** and the **MobileNet-SSD** deep learning model. It detects multiple objects from a live webcam feed and displays bounding boxes with confidence scores.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time object detection using webcam
- Lightweight and fast MobileNet-SSD model
- Detects common objects like person, car, bottle, mobile, etc.
- Bounding boxes with class labels and confidence

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (DNN)
- MobileNet-SSD
- NumPy
- Imutils



##  Installation
1. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils numpy
